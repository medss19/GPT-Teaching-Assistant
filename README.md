# DSA Teaching Assistant

A **Software Engineering Intern Assignment** that creates an interactive chat application UI functioning as a teaching assistant for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems. This application leverages GPT to provide guided assistance without revealing direct solutions.

## Overview

This application allows users to:
- Submit LeetCode problem URLs
- Ask specific questions about DSA problems
- Receive guided hints and intuition-building responses
- Develop problem-solving skills through interactive dialogue

The GPT-powered teaching assistant is designed to help users understand problems better rather than providing ready-made solutions. It functions as a mentor that guides users toward developing their own solutions.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.0.0 or higher)
- NPM (v6.0.0 or higher)
- Gemini API key

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/medss19/GPT-Teaching-Assistant.git
   cd GPT-Teaching-Assistant/frontend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory:
   ```sh
   VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

4. **Run Development Server**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Build for Production**
   ```sh
   npm run build
   npm run preview  # To preview the build
   ```

## Architecture

The application follows a modular React architecture built with Vite for optimal performance and developer experience.

### Core Components

```
App (Root)
├── Chat (Main Container)
│   ├── ChatHeader (Title & Controls)
│   ├── ChatMessages (Conversation Display)
│   │   └── MessageItem (Individual Messages)
│   └── ChatInput (User Input)
└── Sidebar (Navigation)
    ├── ConversationList (Chat History)
    └── BookmarkedList (Saved Conversations)
```

### Key Files and Their Functions

- **App.jsx**: Application entry point and routing
- **Chat.jsx**: Main container orchestrating the chat interface
- **useChat.js**: Custom hook managing chat state and logic
- **api.js**: API communication with the Gemini model
- **systemPrompts.js**: Structured prompts for GPT interaction
- **teachingPatterns.js**: Educational patterns for guiding users

### State Management

The application uses React's Context API and custom hooks to manage:
- Conversation history
- Current chat state
- Bookmarked conversations
- User preferences

## Usage Guidelines

### Starting a New Conversation

1. Click the "New Conversation" button in the sidebar
2. Enter a LeetCode problem URL in the input field:
   ```
   https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/
   ```
3. Type your specific doubt or question:
   ```
   I understand we need to find two numbers that add up to the target, but I'm not sure how to avoid the O(n²) approach
   ```
4. Press Enter or click the Send button

### Managing Conversations

- **Switch Conversations**: Click on any conversation in the sidebar
- **Bookmark**: Click the bookmark icon (limited to 2 bookmarks)
- **Delete**: Click the delete icon to remove a conversation
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle using the button in the chat header

## GPT Integration & Prompt Design

The application integrates with the Gemini API to leverage GPT capabilities for teaching assistance.

### Prompt Engineering

For a comprehensive explanation of our prompt engineering approach, please see our [DSA Teaching Assistant Prompt Guide](./Prompt%20Guide.md).

Prompts are carefully designed to:
1. **Analyze Problems**: Extract key information from LeetCode URLs
2. **Guide Rather Than Solve**: Help users discover solutions independently
3. **Build Intuition**: Develop problem-solving patterns and techniques
4. **Provide Analogies**: Explain complex concepts with relatable examples
5. **Encourage Reflection**: Ask questions that deepen understanding

### Sample Prompt Structure

```javascript
const basePrompt = `
You are a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) teaching assistant.
Your goal is to help the student understand the problem and develop their own solution.
NEVER provide the complete solution. Instead:
1. Help them understand the problem statement
2. Guide them to identify key patterns or algorithms
3. Provide small hints that build intuition
4. Ask leading questions to develop their problem-solving skills
`;
```

### API Integration

The application communicates with the Gemini API using:

```javascript
const callGeminiAPI = async (prompt) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(GEMINI_API_ENDPOINT, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        contents: [{ parts: [{ text: prompt }] }],
        generationConfig: {
          temperature: 0.7,
          maxOutputTokens: 2048,
        },
      }),
    });
    
    // Process and return response
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error calling Gemini API:', error);
    return { error: true, message: 'Failed to get response' };
  }
};
```
